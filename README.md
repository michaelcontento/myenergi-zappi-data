# myenergy-data

This repository contains (in the `data/` folder) the raw data of my [Zappi][] wallbox retreived from the official MyEnergi API. 

I do this, as the API of MyEnergi is very slow, sometimes unstable and I'm also a bit a data hoarder :joy:

A GitHub Action will auto-import new files every morning and (currently) we store the most granular data available (one datapoint per minute).

## File format / API schema

As there is no official API documentation we have to use informations gathered by the community. For this please head over to [MyEnergi-App-Api].

But for archival purpose (maybe the MyEnergi-App-Api repo get removed sometime), here the infos for the files we store:

```json
{
  "min": 1,		    // Minute
  "dow": "Sat",		// Day of week
  "dom": 8,		    // Day of month
  "mon": 6,		    // Month
  "yr": 2019,		  // Year
  "imp": 42900,		// Imported Joules this minute; divide by 60 get average Watts; divide by 3600000 to get kWh
  "exp": xxxxx,		// Exported Joules
  "gen": 180,		  // ???
  "gep": xxxxx,		// Generated Joules
  "h1d": xxxxx,		// Phase 1 used Joules for charging
  "h2d": xxxxx,		// Phase 2 used Joules for charging
  "h3d": xxxxx,		// Phase 3 used Joules for charging
  "v1": 2446,		  // Voltage
  "frq": 5006,		// Frequency
  "nect1": 42900
}
```
